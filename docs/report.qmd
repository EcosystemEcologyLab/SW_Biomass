## Data

So far the data products include:

| Product                               | Downloaded | Wrangled |
|---------------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Xu AGBC                               | ✅         | ✅       |
| Liu AGBC                              | ✅         | ✅       |
| LT-GNN AGB                            | ✅         | ✅       |
| Chopping AGB                          | ✅         | ✅       |
| Menlove AGB                           | ✅         | ✅       |
| ESA CCI/GlobBiomass AGB v004          | ✅         | ✅       |
| GEDI L4B AGB v2.1                     | ✅         | ✅       |
| Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) AGB | ✅         | ✅       |

RAP is a model product only for rangelands (i.e. annual or perennial grasses and forbs) and is not included in comparisons right now.

## Figures

@fig-agbmap shows all of the data products transformed to the same extent and resolution.
In an attempt to get a spatial sense of where these datasets agree/disagree the most, @fig-sdmap shows the standard deviation across the pixels.
@fig-violin shows the distribution of (a sample of) AGB values for each data product.

Observations:

-   The Liu product doesn't include *any* zeros

-   The Xu product has the largest area of low but not zero values

-   The ESA product has the greatest total range of values

-   The ESA product has some very high AGB pixels surrounded by very low (maybe zero?) AGB pixels—this may be an artifact of some kind?

Alternatively, we can use ridge plots to display this.

{{< downloadthis fig/agb_ridge.png label="Download .png" >}}

This might be more readable if we transform the x-axis (e.g. log(x+1) or sqrt()).

### Scatter plots

These plots are intended to compare each data product with the "gold standard" ESA product.
These use a random sample of 200,000 pixels from each product.
While it is technically possible to make these plots using the entire dataset, the result will be a dark black blob for all of them.
200,000 points is only \~0.5% (total non-NA pixels = 35,342,827).

### Point density plots

A point density plot is great for when a scatter plot contains many over-plotted points.
These plots use the [`ggpointdensity`](https://github.com/LKremer/ggpointdensity) package which extends `ggplot2`.
Color represents density of data under each point.
Because of the abundance of zeros, if the full dataset is plotted without any tansformation of the color scale, there is always a single bright spot in the lower left corner, but I think a log scale makes enough sense to use.

This is an example of what it could look like, but there are technical barriers to getting it to work: <https://github.com/cct-datascience/SW_Biomass/issues/18>.
For now, maybe the scatter plots are good enough?
