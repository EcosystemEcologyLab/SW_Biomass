## Data

So far the data products include:

| Product                               | Downloaded | Wrangled |
|---------------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Xu AGBC                               | ✅         | ✅       |
| Liu AGBC                              | ✅         | ✅       |
| LT-GNN AGB                            | ✅         | ✅       |
| Chopping AGB                          | ✅         | ✅       |
| Menlove AGB                           | ✅         | ✅       |
| ESA CCI/GlobBiomass AGB v004          | ✅         | ✅       |
| GEDI L4B AGB v2.1                     | ✅         | ✅       |
| Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) AGB | ✅         | ✅       |

RAP is a model product only for rangelands (i.e. annual or perennial grasses and forbs) and is not included in comparisons right now.

## Figures

@fig-agbmap shows all of the data products transformed to the same extent and resolution.
In an attempt to get a spatial sense of where these datasets agree/disagree the most, @fig-sdmap shows the standard deviation across the pixels.
@fig-violin shows the distribution of (a sample of) AGB values for each data product.

Observations:

-   The Liu product doesn't include *any* zeros

-   The Xu product has the largest area of low but not zero values

-   The ESA product has the greatest total range of values

-   The ESA product has some very high AGB pixels surrounded by very low (maybe zero?) AGB pixels—this may be an artifact of some kind?

![Map of standard deviation of each raster pixel across all datasets. This is a "placeholder" for a map of agreement/disagreement across the data products. Standard deviation almost certainly isn't the best metric for this, but it at least gives a sense of where there is more or less variability.](fig/sd_map.png){#fig-sdmap}

### Data distribution

### Pointdensity

These plots are intended to compare each data product with the "gold standard" ESA product.

A point density plot is great for when a scatter plot contains so many over-plotted points that it becomes kind of unreadable.
Color represents density of data points under each colored point.
Because of the abundance of zeros, if the full dataset is plotted, there is always a single bright spot in the lower left corner and basically all other points are dark purple.
Also, only the slower computation method seems to work when all the zeros are included.
I've come up with three options for dealing with this that I think could make sense.
