## Data

So far the data products include:

| Product                               | Downloaded | Wrangled |
|---------------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Xu AGBC                               | ✅         | ✅       |
| Liu AGBC                              | ✅         | ✅       |
| LT-GNN AGB                            | ✅         | ✅       |
| Chopping AGB                          | ✅         | ✅       |
| Menlove AGB                           | ✅         | ✅       |
| ESA CCI/GlobBiomass AGB v004          | ✅         | ✅       |
| GEDI L4B AGB v2.1                     | ✅         |          |
| Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) AGB | ✅         | ✅       |

RAP is a model product only for rangelands (i.e. annual or perennial grasses and forbs) and is not included in comparisons right now.

## Figures

@fig-agbmap shows all of the data products transformed to the same extent and resolution.
In an attempt to get a spatial sense of where these datasets agree/disagree the most, @fig-sdmap shows the standard deviation across the pixels.
@fig-violin shows the distribution of (a sample of) AGB values for each data product.

Observations:

-   The Liu product doesn't include *any* zeros

-   The Xu product has the largest area of low but not zero values

-   The ESA product has the greatest total range of values

-   The ESA product has some very high AGB pixels surrounded by very low (maybe zero?) AGB pixels—this may be an artifact of some kind?

![Map of standard deviation of each raster pixel across all datasets. This is a "placeholder" for a map of agreement/disagreement across the data products. Standard deviation almost certainly isn't the best metric for this, but it at least gives a sense of where there is more or less variability.](fig/sd_map.png){#fig-sdmap}
